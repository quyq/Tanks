 - libsdl2-ttf-dev
 - libsdl2-image-dev
 - libsdl2-mixer-dev
 - doxygen-gui - _for docs generation (optional)_
 - doxygen - _for docs generation (optional)_

On Debian based systems you can run (**apt** can by replaced with **apt-get** or **aptitude**):

`sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev` 

### Mac

#### Requirements

 - make
 - sdl2
 - sdl2_ttf
 - sdl2_image
 - sdl2_mixer

`brew install sdl2 sdl2_ttf sdl2_image sdl2_mixer`

#### Compilation

In the project directory run:

`make clean all`

As a result **build** directory should be created.

 - GitBash or any similar package providing **cp** and **rm** commands

#### Compilation
